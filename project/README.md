A program that determines a minimum weight spanning tree in a weighted connected graph.  

A weighted graph is a triple (𝑉,𝐸,𝑤) where 𝐺=(𝑉,𝐸) is an (undirected) graph and 𝑤:𝐸→ℝ is a weight function on edges.  A spanning subgraph of a graph 𝐺 is a subgraph 𝐻 such that 𝑉(𝐻)=𝑉(𝐺), i.e. 𝐻 includes all vertices of 𝐺.  A spanning tree in 𝐺 is a spanning subgraph that is also a tree.  The weight of a spanning tree 𝑇 in a weighted graph 𝐺 is the sum of the weights of all edges in 𝑇.
